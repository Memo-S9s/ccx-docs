## Cloudstack
###  Overview
By supporting CloudStack cloud providers, CCX provides a robust platform to facilitate the deployment and management of database instances as part of DBaaS offerings. 
This integration leverages CloudStack's infrastructure management capabilities, enabling users to automate database provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, all while 
benefiting from the agility and flexibility that cloud environments offer.

CCX allows users to leverage CloudStackâ€™s API to automate the creation, configuration, and deployment of databases, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

### Requirements 
To enable full DBaaS functionality and seamless integration with CloudStack, CCX requires specific resources and access via the CloudStack API. Below are the detailed requirements for deploying and managing database services using CCX within a CloudStack environment.


### Prerequisites
#### API Access:
CCX requires access to the CloudStack API to interact with the cloud infrastructure programmatically. This enables automated provisioning, management, and scaling of database instances.

#### Required Resources

For the proper functioning of CCX with CloudStack, the following resources must be available:

##### Compute Resources (Virtual Machines):
CCX needs the ability to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) within CloudStack. These VMs serve as the foundation for hosting database instances and must be provisioned dynamically based on workload requirements.

##### Public IP Addresses:
CCX must be able to acquire and assign public IP addresses to the deployed VMs. This ensures proper network connectivity and allows external clients to access the database services hosted on these VMs.

##### Firewall Configuration:
CCX requires the ability to create and manage firewall rules for the VMs. This is essential for securing database instances by controlling traffic and defining which ports and protocols are allowed for communication.

##### Volume Management:
CCX must be able to acquire and attach storage volumes to the VMs for database storage. Only volumes with configurable size are supported, allowing users to define storage capacity according to their specific database needs.
The CCX requirements from Cloudstack:

### Configuration
#### CCX Cloudstack configuration
To add a cloudstack providers we need to add new section under `clouds:` in the `ccx-values-config.yaml` config file.
```yaml

            info:

                name: zone1 # zone name, it will be displayed in the UI
                network_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 # The uuid of the network that will be used within the zoneiu
```

- *Zone Support:*
At present, CCX supports a single zone per region, ensuring streamlined resource management and deployment consistency within each designated region. 

- *Disk Support:*
CCX supports only disks with configurable, custom sizes. This flexibility allows users to specify disk capacities according to the specific needs of their database workloads, ensuring efficient storage allocation and scaling based on demand.

#### Deployer configuration file ccx-values-deployer
The cloudstack provides has to defined under the `cloudstack_vendors`, here is an example
```yaml
        cloudstack_vendors:
          mycloud:
            url: "http://192.168.50.147:12345/client/api"
            verify_ssl: false
            no_expunge: false
            template_id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            network_id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            zone: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            database_vendors:

                    ip_protocol: tcp
                    to_port: 65535
              - name: percona
                security_groups:
                  - cidr: x.x.x.x/32
                    from_port: 22
                    ip_protocol: tcp
                    to_port: 22
                  - cidr: x.x.x.x/32
                    from_port: 1000

              - name: postgres
                security_groups:
                  - cidr: x.x.x.x/32
                    from_port: 22
                    ip_protocol: tcp
                    to_port: 22
                  - cidr: 37.30.16.41/32
                    from_port: 1000
                    ip_protocol: tcp
                    to_port: 65535
              - name: redis
                security_groups:
                  - cidr: x.x.x.x/32
                    from_port: 22

                    from_port: 1000
                    ip_protocol: tcp
                    to_port: 65535
```

The `no_expunge` set to false means that the VM, along with all its details, will be destroyed. 

- *Network and Zone Configuration:*
The `network_id` and zone will act as the default values for regions, ensuring consistent configuration across deployments.

- *Database Vendor Settings:*
The `database_vendors` section defines the default rules required for CMON to connect to the database nodes. The cidr: x.x.x.x/32 in database_vendors represents the IP address of the CCX deployment within the Kubernetes cluster, or the NAT gateway IP. This is the source IP that connects to and manages the database nodes across different networks. This will create security rules for every node in the datastore. The x.x.x.x must be updated to reflect the actual IP address of the current deployment for proper connectivity.

#### Cloudstack credentials
We store Cloudstack credentials in the Kubernetes secrets.
In the Kubernetes secret we will have two values for API_KEY and API_SECRET_KEY

The name of this variables should as follows &lt;name_of_the_cloudstack_vendor&gt;_CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY and &lt;name_of_the_cloudstack_vendor&gt;_CLOUDSTACK_API_SECRET_KEY.

In our case the cloudstack vendor is called `mycloud` so we need to create secret named `mycloud`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MYCLOUD_CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY: base64_encoed_api_key
  MYCLOUD_CLOUDSTACK_API_SECRET_KEY: base64_encoded_secret_api_key
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: mycloud 
type: Opaque
```

The secret has to be included in the ccx-values under the cloudSecrets.

```yaml
  cloudSecrets:
    - cloudstack
```

#### S3 backup storage
For the Cloudstack S3 backup, we need to create a Kubernetes secret with S3 storage informations and credentials.
`CLOUDSTACK_S3_INSECURE_SSL` can be set to true if you don't have a valid TLS cert for your s3 endpoint.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MYCLOUD_S3_ACCESSKEY: <base64_access_key>
  MYCLOUD_S3_BUCKETNAME: <base64_bucket_name>
  MYCLOUD_S3_ENDPOINT: <base64_endpoint>
  MYCLOUD_S3_SECRETKEY: <base64_secret_key>
  MYCLOUD_S3_INSECURE_SSL: <base64_true_or_false>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloudstack-s3
type: Opaque
```

:::note
  For the key MYCLOUD_S3_ENDPOINT: <base64_endpoint>, if you are using an AWS S3 bucket, the endpoint should be provided without the https details.
:::

The secret has to be included in the ccx-values under the cloudSecrets.

```yaml
  cloudSecrets:
    - cloudstack-s3
```
